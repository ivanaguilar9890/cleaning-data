# cleaning-data
Took real-world data from askamanger.org where people among other things, could submit how much they earn, job title, and country. Because some data was manually entered there was bound to be inconsistencies in the dataset. Thus the goal of this project was to apply data-cleaning techniques to improve usability of this dataset.
